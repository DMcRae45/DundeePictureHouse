    <p>As a recently established cinema, we realise it is not easy for a project to get off the ground. Knowing this, we are reaching out to budding film-makers and local talent to showcase their movies at our cinema.</p>
    <p>We are looking for imaginative and creative works that exhibit the meaning of independent cinema.</p>
    <p>All enquiries can be made at independentmovies@dphenquiries.com./p>
    <p>Terms and conditions apply.</p>
